# need  to continue from here, need to get a working API method and start some queries.
# first queries I want are the following:
# movie title compares to radarr and returns. Parse out title and more
# show goes in and items come out, parse episode level information
# plex parse play status
# tagging for sonarr/radarr
# have validation for both API's being reachable for new links
