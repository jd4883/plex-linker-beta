    "overview": "Ed and Al hear of a blind alchemist named Judau who had supposedly performed a successful human transmutation. Meeting up with him, Judau reveals to Ed that a young girl named Rosalie was ressurected through alchemy, with his eyes paid for in equivalent exhcange. However, the Madam refuses to teach Ed about the techniques used. Rosalie leads Al to a room with a little girl's shrivelled corpse inside. She reveals this as the result of the real Rosalie's transmutation, whilst she herself is a girl named Amy who was adopted due to her similar appearance. As Ed arrives on the scene, the Madam tells him that her late husband kept the truth about the transmutation's failure from Judau, who truly wanted to ressurect Rosalie. Ed and Al then leave, carrying this knowledge with them as well.",

    "overview": "While on their way back to Resembool to have Ed's arm repaired, Ed and Al buy earrings as souvenirs for Winry to prevent her from getting mad about the broken automail. Later on, Ed fights an assassin and his automail gets broken again, and he buys more earrings for Winry to avoid her wrath. Winry explains that she decided to pierce her ears after meeting Riza on the day Ed decided to become a State Alchemist. Meanwhile, Riza explains to her colleague that she grew her hair long after meeting Winry that same day. Her colleague comments on how simple a reason that is, and Riza says that reasons are always simple. To explain her choice, she remarks that they are all living in a simple world - where when they shoot their enemies, their enemies die.",

    "overview": "Years ago, Roy's desire to become a state alchemist is disapproved of by his teacher, Berthold Hawkeye, Riza's father. Before he died of an illness, he asks Roy to look after Riza, who has an alchemic symbol on her back. In the present, Ed visits Riza to return the gun she gave him and asks about Ishbal. After the war broke out, Bradley passed a document announcing the extermination of the Ishbalans. This takes it toll on many alchemists, including Roy which isn't helped by the taunts of Kimblee, who enjoys killing. As Marcoh tells Scar his side of the story, he reveals that he was involved in using Isbalans to make the Philosopher's Stone, which was given to the state alchemists to enhance their alchemy. The Ishbalan leader tried pleading with Bradley to end the killing in exchange for his life, but was rejected. When the war finally ended, Roy resolved that he would work to become the new Fuhrer to protect the people and appointed Riza as her second-in-command. Riza mentions to Ed that when they finally achieve peace, they may have to be punished for the people they have killed. When Envy checks Marcoh's cell, he finds nothing left but a beheaded corpse and the word \"vengeance\" written in blood on the wall.",

However, May had run off, so they go and look for her. Meanwhile, Riza, Breda, Fuery and Halman say their goodbyes as they are sent to different HQs, with Roy finding a hidden message inside a chess set Halman gave him. Roy later reminds Ed that he owes him 520 cenz, but Ed decides to keep ahold of it until he becomes Fuhrer. Roy uses the note he got from Falman to make contact with Grumman. Meanwhile, Fu is shocked to find Lan Fan had lost her arm, and declines Ed's help to find an automail mechanic, since it would involve his acquaintances in their troubles. Afterwards, Knox gets a visit from his children, who are pleased to hear he's been able to successfully treat patients. Realising that Marcoh had escaped along with Scar, Envy releases Kimbley from prison, giving him to the task to retrieve Marcoh and kill Scar. Wanting to find out more about Kimbley and the secrets behind his brother's alchemy, Scar destroys Marcoh's face so it won't be recognised, before heading off to the North to recover his brother's notes.",

When Kimblee gets word that Scar and Marcoh are on a train, he boards it by having another train run alongside it, but instead of finding Marcoh, he finds Yoki there. Kimblee is then attacked by Scar, and the two recognize each other from their previous encounter years ago. Before Kimblee can really do anything, Scar impales him with a metal pipe, and this leaves Kimblee no choice but to use his alchemy to separate the two parts of the train, with Scar on the other part. Realizing that something happened, the trainâ€™s operators stop it and find the injured Kimblee, but he orders them to keep going. Unbeknownst to Kimblee, the real Marcoh is heading north on foot with May Chang. The two eventually reach the shack where Scarâ€™s brotherâ€™s research is located, and they find it intact.",

The confused Sloth walks out of the elevator and immediately gets fuel spilled onto him by Buccaneer's group and is pushed over the railings with a combined effort from Olivier's tank, Falman, and the Elrics.

After freezing Sloth, Olivier orders Buccaneer to put the Elrics into the fort's holding cells so she can question them later. The next morning, the Elrics are thanked by several soldiers for helping during Sloth's invasion, but the soldiers still wouldn't let the Elrics out of their cell.",

Olivier sends a search party down the tunnels, who find a couple of survivors warning them not to put any lights on. Riza learns that Bradley's son, Selim, is a homunculus named Pride who attacks from the shadows. Kimblee orders Ed to search for Scar and Marcoh and create a bloody crest similar to Ishbal in Briggs, tempting him with a Philosopher's Stone if he accepts. After telling Al and Winry all about it, he grudgingly accepts the job, though doesn't intend to use the stone himself. As Ed and Al go to search for Scar, their real intent to find May as well, Winry decides to accompany them.",

Meanwhile, 'Father' dreams of ancient Xerxes, where Hohenheim was raised as a nameless slave. There, Hohenheim met Homunculus, a being in a flask who was created from his blood, which gave Hohenheim his current name and taught him the basics of alchemy. One night, Homunculus was summoned by the King of Xerxes, who asked Homunculus to tell him the secret for immortality. Homunculus tricked the king into making a gigantic transmutation circle, using the whole country as a sacrifice, while it and Hohenheim stood at the center of the circle. When Hohenheim awoke, everyone else in Xerxes was dead, except for Homunculus. It created a body shaped like Hohenheim for itself, becoming 'Father.' Back in the present, after Hohenheim awakes from this shared dream, he runs into Izumi and Sig. When Hohenheim notices Izumi's sin, he rearranges her organs so that her blood can flow better. After this, Hohenheim tells Izumi and Sig that he is a Philosopher's Stone in human form.",

As Scar's group exits the mine, they find Al, who warns them about Central infiltrating Briggs, so Scar decides to take them towards an Ishbalan slum. Miles' group attempts to snipe Kimblee, but Kimblee has already figured out their intent and uses a cover of snow to enter the mines. Ed tries to follow, but is attacked by two more chimeras. Ed disables them by using the ammonia in dynamite to make a stink bomb to overwhelm their high sense of smell. Ed then knocks the Philosopher's Stone out of Kimblee's hand, but Kimblee uses another Stone hidden inside his mouth, sending Ed and the chimeras down a mine shaft and leaving Ed impaled by a steel bar. At the same time, Al starts to drift out of consciousness, saying his soul is being drawn back to his body. Determined not to die, Ed gets the chimeras to remove the bar while he sacrifices some of his life span to temporarily fix the wound and to stop the bleeding. The chimeras find the Philosopher's Stone that Kimblee dropped, and, thankful for their rescue, decide to take Ed to a doctor.",

Before Roy can kill Envy, Ed, Riza, and Scar persuade him to let go of his anger and his need for revenge, for Amestris cannot be ruled by someone consumed with hatred. Envy becomes outraged by Roy's change of heart and rants about why everyone does not kill each other, trying to goad them into doing so by pointing out all of the terrible things they have done to each other. Ed determines that the reason Envy hates humans is because he is jealous of their capacity to continue living on, despite all the abuse they take.

Meanwhile, the Armstrong siblings begin to gain the upper hand in their battle against Sloth; Izumi arrives in Central, allied with Briggs soldiers, to participate in the coup; and Hohenheim confronts Father alone.",

    "overview": "Everyone closest to the center of Father's nationwide transmutation circle, including Ed's group, survives to discover that Father has used the souls of over fifty million Amestrians to suppress God within a new, youthful body. Father neutralizes everyone's alchemy, but, before he can annihilate them, Hohenheim reveals his countermeasure: he had spent years traveling the country, placing fragments of his own Philosopher's Stone into the earth to use as foundation for returning the Amestrian souls to their bodies. The stone fragments are activated by the eclipse's umbra, and the souls are ripped from Father's body back into their original bodies, which weakens Father to the point of barely being able to suppress God anymore. The eclipse then lifts, blinding Bradley with sunlight and allowing Scar to kill him. Scar activates the nationwide alkahestry circle his brother and fellow Ishbalans had been preparing, which restores everyone else's alchemy at their greatest potential. Facing the full strength of his opponents' attacks in his unstable body, Father retreats aboveground to find more souls and replenish his stone supply. Ed remains behind to fight Pride while everyone else chases Father. Pride tries to steal Ed's body to replace his own unstable one, but Kimblee's soul reappears within him and taunts him while Ed enters his body and destroys it, reverting him to the form of a small fetus-like creature. Ed spares Pride's life and leaves to join his friends.",

They barely manage to survive the blast, but Al and Hohenheim take some heavy damage protecting the others. Before Father can kill Ed and Izumi, the Briggs soldiers, along with several of Ed's allies, join up to attack Father and use up his stone supply. Father lets down his barrier temporarily to try and absorb Greed's stone, giving Ed, Alex and Izumi the opportunity to damage him to the point of defending himself manually. As Father starts to lose control, he creates a blast which traps Ed's arm whilst his automail arm is destroyed. With Ed in danger, Al convinces May to help him perform a transmutation, trading his soul for the return of Ed's right arm. Al rejoins with his body on the other side and with his arm returned, Ed frees himself to unleash a series of blows on Father.",

Greed decides to part from Lin's body, and uses his carbonization ability to turn Father's body into weak charcoal. Father extinguishes Greed's soul, killing him, but Ed punches through Father's chest, releasing all the souls of the people of Xerxes and sending Father to the Gate of Truth where he is trapped for eternity. In the wake of Father's defeat, everyone mourns Al's sacrifice. Ed rejects using a Philosopher's Stone to bring him back to life, even after Hohenheim offers his final life as an apology for the pain Ed and Al were forced through. Ed ultimately decides to perform a human transmutation on himself, sacrificing his own Gate and his ability to use alchemy with it. As a reward for discovering he doesn't need to perform alchemy, Ed is allowed to bring Al back with him in his original body. As everyone recuperates from the battle, Hohenheim returns to Resembool and dies peacefully before Trisha's grave.",
